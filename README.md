Insurance Analytics Dashboard: End-to-End SQL & Power BI Project

📌 Executive Summary
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of over 10,000 insurance policy records across five major sectors: Auto, Health, Home, Life, and Travel. By bridging the gap between raw database management and interactive data visualization, the dashboard tracks revenue performance, claim status trends, and customer demographics to drive data-informed decision-making.

🛠️ Technical Stack
Database: SQL Server (Data Storage & Schema Management)

Visualization: Power BI (Reporting & UI/UX)

Logic: DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for calculated measures

ETL: SQL queries for data cleaning and transformation

📊 Business Insights (Key Findings)
Based on the analysis of the dataset, the following key trends were identified:

Revenue Leader: Travel Insurance is the primary revenue driver, contributing approximately $2.48M (nearly 41%) of the total $5.98M in premium revenue.

Claim Friction: A significant 43.5% of all claims are currently Rejected, indicating a potential need for policy clarification or stricter underwriting processes.

Settlement Velocity: Only 33.8% of claims have reached "Settled" status, with a large volume of "Pending" cases in the pipeline.

Target Demographics: The average policyholder age is 52 years, suggesting a mature customer base that leans heavily toward Health and Life coverage in later stages.
